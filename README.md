## Heart-disease-Prediction-ML

**Through data loading, exploration, visualization, and the application of a logistic regression model to predict heart disease. Each section helps in understanding the data better and evaluating the performance of the predictive model.**

## Splitting Data > Training the model > Evaluating the model > Model Performance > Accuracy Results.

## a step-by-step guide to:

• Load and inspect the data.
• Visualize distributions and relationships between variables.
• Identify correlations.
• Build and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict heart disease.
• This process helps in understanding the data better and developing a predictive model to 
• Identify individuals with heart disease based on various health metrics.
